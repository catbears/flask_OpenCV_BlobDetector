# Flask - Blob detector

This is a simple Flask app that uses OpenCV to detect blobs in an image.

It shows a website with a form to upload an image and a button to process it. The image is then processed and the result is shown next to the original image.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to use Github Co-Pilot and ChatGPT for most of the coding work. For now they did about 95% of the lines. The frame was made by ChatGPT, details came from Copilot and some stuff was coded by myself. If you want features or want to contribute with generated code, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
